This application is a social media platform built using React and Firebase.

The application features a robust authentication system, enabling users to register and log in securely. This system is built using Firebase’s authentication services, ensuring the security and integrity of user data.

The application also includes protected routes, ensuring that only authenticated users can access certain parts of the application.

The real-time capabilities of Firestore enable instant updates across all active clients, enhancing the interactivity of the application.
